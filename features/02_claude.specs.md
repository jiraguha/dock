### Stateless Claude Integration

I want configuring **Claude** to work in a **stateless** mode so that contributors can launch and use Claude’s code generation or enhancement capabilities **without needing prior context**. The goal is to ensure that:

* Anyone can clone the repository and immediately use Claude to improve or extend the project.
* Claude should be able to analyze the codebase and assist without relying on prior conversations or state.
* Project structure, comments, and prompts will be optimized to provide **enough local context** within the code itself.
* Ensures Claude can work without prior context (via CLAUDE.md or skills)
* Improves code comments and structure to support in-place understanding
* Makes onboarding easier for new contributors

This setup is intended to support seamless collaboration and reduce onboarding friction for new contributors.
