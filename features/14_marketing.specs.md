## Short Pitch (30 seconds)

Every time I launched Docker, my laptop turned into a jet engine. Fans spinning, battery draining, productivity dying.

So I built **dock** — one command spins up a remote dev environment. Docker and Kubernetes run in the cloud, but it *feels* completely local.

```bash
dock create    # Spin up your environment
dock ssh       # You're in
docker ps      # Just works
```

Use any machine — even big GPUs for ML. Snapshot your setup. Destroy when done. **Zero cost when idle.**

## Tweet Version (280 chars)

Tired of your laptop sounding like a jet engine when running Docker?

I built `dock` — spin up remote dev environments in seconds. Docker & K8s in the cloud, feels local.

One command: `dock create`

Snapshot. Destroy. Zero cost when idle.

## One-liner

**dock** — Disposable remote dev environments. Run Docker & Kubernetes without melting your laptop.

## Elevator Pitch (60 seconds)

Running Docker locally is brutal. Your laptop heats up, fans go crazy, battery dies in an hour.

**dock** fixes this. One command creates a cloud VM with Docker and Kubernetes pre-installed. SSH multiplexing, port forwarding, everything is automatic. It feels exactly like developing locally — except your laptop stays silent.

The killer features:
- **Snapshots** — save your configured environment, boot in seconds next time
- **GPU support** — spin up L4/H100 instances for ML workloads
- **Zero cost** — destroy when done, pay nothing when idle

Install it, run `dock create`, and never hear your fan again.

## Key Messages

1. **Silent development** — No more fan noise, no battery drain
2. **Feels local** — SSH, Docker, kubectl all work transparently
3. **Disposable** — Create, destroy, recreate. Identical every time
4. **Fast restart** — Snapshots boot in seconds, not minutes
5. **Pay for what you use** — Stop or destroy to stop billing
